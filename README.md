# PowerTool_6xx

### Abstracts

This code is to implement full trading rules of Powertool6. Coding approach is to write flowing flows that articulate the story of the trading rules into logic flow, with elements are self-explanatory, well-articulated writing, so that, translating the .PAS code into .MQ4 is easy to do. The system written in .PAS is to demonstrate the logic on Forex Tester, so that I can see the flow and dynamics of the rule, while also to provide translatable code to .MQ4 for implementation on production platform (a VPS with Metatrader 4 Terminal).
